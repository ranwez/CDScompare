# Annotation Comparison

This is the repository for the 2024 internship of Vetea Jacot in the GE²pop team of the research unit AGAP. The goal of the program defined in this repo is to enable the comparison of multiple genome annotations to determine the closest automatic annotation to a reference. This program takes into account multiple caracteristics of the problem, for exemple the reading frames of a locus.
